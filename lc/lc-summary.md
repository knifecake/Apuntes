# Context-Free Grammars

- The **set of sequences** over a set $X$, called $X^*$ is another set such
  that:
  - $\varepsilon$ is a sequence called the empty sequence, and
  - if $z$ is a sequence and $a \in X$ then $az$ is also a sequence.
  We use lowercase letters from the end of the latin alphabet to denote
  sequences: $z, y, x, \dots$

- An **alphabet** is a finite set $X$. Its elements are called symbols and are
  usually denoted by lowercase letters from the beginning of the latin
  alphabet: $a, b, c, \dots$

- A **language** is a subset of $T^*$ for some alphabet $T$. Examples of
  languages over an alphabet $T$ are $T^*, \emptyset, \{\varepsilon\}$ and $T$
  itself.

- A **sentence** (often called **word**) is any element of a language.

- **Language operations.** Let $L$ and $M$ be languages over an alphabet $T$. Then,
  - $\overline{L} = T^* - L$ is the complement of $L$,
  - $L^R = \{s^R \mid s \in L\}$ is the reverse of $L$,
  - $LM = \{st \mid s \in L,\ t\in M\}$ is the concatenation of $L$ and $M$,
  - $L^0 = \{\varepsilon\}$ is the 0-th power of $L$,
  - $L^{n+1} = LL^n$ is the $(n + 1)$-th power of $L$,
  - $L^* = \bigcup_{i\in\N} L^i$ is the start-closure of $L$,
  - $L^+ = \bigcup_{i\in\N,\ i > 0}$ is the positive clousre of $L$.
  And the following properties hold:
  - $L^+ = LL*$, and
  - $L^* = \{\varepsilon\} \cup L^+$.

- A **grammar** is a shorthand syntax for an inductive definition of a
  language, where we use
  - Monospace characters for **terminals**, i.e. symbols of the alphabet.
  - Capital letters for **nonterminals**, i.e. auxiliary symbols that are not
      part of the alphabet but are part of the language.
  - **Production rules** of the form $\alpha \to \beta$, where $\alpha$ is
      always a non-terminal.
  - A **nonterminal start symbol**, which can be $\varepsilon$.

- A **context-free grammar** is a four-tuple $(T, N, R, S)$ where
  - $T$ is a finite set of terminal symbols (alphabet),
  - $N$ is a finite set of nonterminal symbols,
  - $R$ is a finite set of production rules of the form $A \to \beta$, where
      $A$ is exactly one nonterminal and $\beta$ is a sequence of terminals and
      nonterminals, and
  - $S$ is the start symbol.

  An example of a context-free grammar is
  $$ P \to \varepsilon \mid a \mid b \mid c \mid  aPa \mid bPb \mid cPc. $$
  A non example of a context-free grammar is $\{a^n b^n c^n \mid n \in \N\}$,
  because in this case the production rules would not be of the form $A \to
  \beta$ where $A$ is exactly one nonterminal.

- A **context-free language** is a language generated by a context-free grammar.
